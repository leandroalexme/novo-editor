## **What can I customize in Polotno editor?**

First, let's talk about the user interface.

The Polotno editor has several main components:

## **Full Control of the Side Panel**

You have complete control over the Side Panel. You can remove the default panels, add your own, and customize their content entirely. For instance, you can create a panel that loads images directly from your backend. Check out the [Side Panel Overview](https://polotno.com/docs/side-panel-overview) for more information.

### **Toolbar, Page Controls, and Tooltip Customization**

You can modify, remove, or add controls and buttons in the [Toolbar](https://polotno.com/docs/toolbar), [Page Controls](https://polotno.com/docs/workspace), and [Tooltip](https://polotno.com/docs/tooltip), allowing you to tailor the interface to your needs.

### **Timeline Customization**

Currently, the **Timeline** component is not customizable. However, you can remove it and implement your own version using the [Store API](https://polotno.com/docs/store-overview).

### **Canvas Customization**

The Canvas component offers several style customization options. You can modify properties like background color and selection tool colors. For more options, refer to the [Workspace Documentation](https://polotno.com/docs/workspace).

### **General Style Customization**

You can also use [CSS to overwrite](https://polotno.com/docs/theme) and customize the general styles of the editor.

### **Data Loading and Export**

You have full control over how data is loaded into the editor, saved, and exported.

For example:

- Load custom templates or a specific userâ€™s design from your backend.

- Save a JSON file to a local computer with a button click.

- Automatically send requests to your backend with design data on any changes.

- Upload design previews or exports to an S3 bucket.


The [Store API](https://polotno.com/docs/store-overview) allows you to implement all of these features, ensuring your data flow fits seamlessly with your infrastructure.
